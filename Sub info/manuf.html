            <h1> Quality Control</h1>
            <address>
              In a standard reactive quality control process, manufacturers produce an item, their quality control unit
              tests it, and they hope to catch and rectify the flaws before the product reaches the market.

              IoT makes this process proactive with thermal and video sensors collecting complete product data through
              different stages of a product cycle. The products can also be tested at each manufacturing step to check
              if their attributes are within specifications. In addition, instrumentation and monitoring of
              manufacturing equipment help quality control personnel to check if and where equipment calibration
              diverges from standard settings – such inaccuracies must be thwarted in time to avoid misalignment of
              products.

            <h1>Inventory Management</h1>
            <address>
              Together with radio frequency identification (RFID), IoT makes inventory management an efficient and
              seamless process. Every item in the inventory gets an RFID tag, and each tag has a unique identification
              number (UID) comprising encoded digital information about the item. RFID readers can scan the tags, and
              the data extracted gets transmitted to the cloud for processing.

              The role of industrial IoT here involves transforming the data acquired by RFID readers into useful
              business insights. It creates a record of the location of inventory items, their statuses and their
              movements in the supply chain and gives users comparable results. For instance, as per the data on
              inventory quantity and location, IoT-based inventory management architecture can help calculate the volume
              of raw materials required for an impending manufacturing cycle.

            <h1> Predictive Maintenance</h1>

            <address>
              Traditionally, manufacturers have employed a time-based approach for planning the maintenance schedules of
              their machinery and equipment. However, according to the ARC group study³, only 18% of equipment fail on
              account of age, whereas 82% of failures occur randomly. This proves that a time-based approach is not
              efficient and may prove costly in the long run.

              Manufacturers can avoid such ineffective maintenance routines by leveraging industrial IoT and data
              science for predictive maintenance. By using IoT sensors (on the equipment), they can monitor its
              operating environment and perform analytics using related data in the cloud to evaluate the actual wear
              and tear. Prompt service and repair enable more efficiency in the maintenance process, better allocation
              of work to field technicians and avoidance of downtime along with more significant cost savings.

            <h1>Smart Metering</h1>
            <address>
              IoT has also introduced the manufacturing sector, utilities and other industries to the world of smart
              meters that can monitor the consumption of water, electric power and other fuels. IoT sensors allow
              organisations to gauge the specific use and deploy practices for more effective usage of resources.

              With customisable end-user dashboards deployed by IoT services vendors, manufacturers can comprehensively
              analyse the results of smart meter monitoring. They can also compare costs, efficiencies and the carbon
              footprint of alternative resources to incorporate better options in their manufacturing processes.
